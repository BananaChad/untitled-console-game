You can modify your inventory to your likings.
ore: amount of ore

# EXTRA INFO

There is no objective. Just get rare ores and flex.<br>
When closing the game your stats can reset because the inventory file gets emptied due to unknown reasons<br>
When opening the game, an index of all the ores gets created in the folder containing the .py file<br>
When a new ore gets added, it gets fetched from the 'serversidedorelist.json' file.<br>
Press "CTRL + ~" before quitting to safely exit the mine.<br>
There's enigmatic+ Discord tracking built into the game. Add your own webhook link and it will work.<br>
If it stops generating ores... **Prepare**

# INSTALLATION TUTORIAL

You need 5 modules: Colorama, Requests, playsound v1.2.2, discord_webhook, and keyboard

Insert these commands into Command Prompt:
```
pip install colorama
pip install requests
pip install playsound==1.2.2
pip install discord_webhook
pip install keyboard
```
We install playsound 1.2.2 because on newer versions it can error.

I have also prepared a requirements.txt file if you want to do all of that in an instant.
Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enjoy
