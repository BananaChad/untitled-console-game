# EXTRA INFO

There is no objective. Just get rare ores and flex.<br>
When closing the game your stats can reset because the inventory file gets wiped due to unknown reasons.<br>
When opening the game, an index of all the ores gets created in the same folder containing the .py file<br>
When new ores gets added, it gets fetched from the 'serversidedorelist.json' file on startup.<br>
Press "CTRL + ~" before quitting to safely save and exit the mine.<br>
There's enigmatic+ Discord tracking built into the game. Add your own discord webhook link, and it will show up.<br>
If it stops generating ores... **Prepare**
