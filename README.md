# EXTRA INFO

There is no objective. Just get rare ores and flex.<br>
When closing the game your stats can reset because the inventory file gets emptied due to unknown reasons<br>
When opening the game, an index of all the ores gets created in the folder containing the .py file<br>
When a new ore gets added, it gets fetched from the 'serversidedorelist.json' file.<br>
If it stops generating ores... **Prepare**

You need 3 modules: Colorama, Requests, and playsound v1.2.2
